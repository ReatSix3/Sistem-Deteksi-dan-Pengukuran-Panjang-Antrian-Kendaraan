# 🚦 Traffic Queue Length Measurement System

This repository contains an **end-to-end traffic queue detection and measurement pipeline** built for real-time CCTV applications.  
It combines deep learning detection (YOLOv8), tracking (ByteTrack), Bird’s Eye View (BEV) transformation, and hybrid measurement methods to **estimate queue length in meters** with high accuracy.
